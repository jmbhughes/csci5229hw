# HW6: James Marcus hughes

## Description
In this final installment, I add textures to the Ferris Wheel Scene. The ferris wheel chair now has a comfy seat, 
an aesthetically pleasing wooden base and back, and a metal foot box area (cannot have it getting scuffed!). The ferris
wheel ring itself is now tie dyed! It has wooden spindles and a metal base. The mug has a cork base, a patterned side, 
a rough interior, and a stripey accent. 

## Build Instructions
Use `make` to build.

## Run Instructions
Run `hw6` executable with no parameters. 

### Keybindings
To interact with the world, rotate your view using the arrow keys. 
To exit, click `escape`.
- `1` : switches to orthogonal overhead view
- `2` : switches to perspective overhead view
- `3` : switches to perspective first person view
- `arrow keys`: in the overhead views, the arrow keys rotate the world so that the world moves beneath you: left/right adjust azimuth while up/down adjust altitude; in the first person view,
                                                                                               the arrow keys allow you to move through the world, the forward/back keys allow you to walk forward 
                                                                                               or backwards while left/right adjusts where you're pointing (in azimuth). 
                                                                                               Your camera cannot tilt up and down and stays at a fixed height.
- `[/]`: Lower/rise light
- `</>` : rotate light around
- `d/D` : decrease/ increase light distance
- `m` : toggles the light motion
- `PgDn/PgUp`:  Zoom in and out
- `o`: toggles through the various scenese
- `esc` : closes the program

### Timing
I spent 3.5 hours on this assignment.
