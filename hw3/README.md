# HW3: James Marcus hughes

## Description
In this homework, I made a three-dimensional scene consisting 
of a couple mugs, a couple ferris wheels, and a ferris wheel seat. The ferris wheel is built of a couple
three-dimensional rings as the support structure. A ring is a hula-hoop object. This support is connected
to a central hub cylinder by some support structs, which are rectangular prisms. Finally, there are chairs
in each ferris wheel. A chair **is not simply a combination of rectangular prisms** because the seat
surface is a smooth logarithm for optimal comfort! You can see this in the single chair blown up. 

Finally, I made a couple mugs. These are water tight objects that can have water poured into them. 

## Build Instructions
Build simply using make. (I've used cmake, but you should be able to call make.) 

## Run Instructions
To run, just execute the `hw3` executable with no parameters. 

### Keybindings
To interact with the world, rotate your view using the arrow keys. 
To exit, click `escape`.
