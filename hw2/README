hw2: Lorenz System

James Marcus Hughes
CSCI5229 Fall 2018

Display Lorenz Attractor with modifiable parameters and views. The color of the curve transitions from
red to blue as the iteration number increases. 

Key bindings:
    s/S     decrease/increase the s paramater
    r/R     decrease/increase the r parameter
    b/B     decrease/increase the b parameter
    arrows  change view angle
    0       reset view angle
    a       toggle axes on and off
    ESC     exit


NOTES:
The Lorenz Attractor is quite interesting, initially discovered by Lorenz while describing weather systems.
( I took a course in chaos theory where we discussed it.) As such, I restricted my variables to postive range
only to mimic the natural system. When r < 0, the curve goes towards the origin instead of to a different point.
For bigger R, the path is much more interesting and oscillates between points.
