hw2: Lorenz System

James Marcus Hughes
CSCI5229 Fall 2018

To build: just make

Display Lorenz Attractor with modifiable parameters and views. The color of the curve transitions from
red to blue as the iteration number increases. 

Key bindings:
    s/S     decrease/increase the s paramater
    r/R     decrease/increase the r parameter
    b/B     decrease/increase the b parameter
    arrows  change view angle
    0       reset view angle
    a       toggle axes on and off
    ESC     exit

I spent approximately 3 hours on this project. I'm not sure of the precise time because the time overlaps
my time on HW1 and HW3. I'll keep my tracking separate from now on. 

NOTES:
The Lorenz Attractor is quite interesting, initially discovered by Lorenz while describing weather systems.
( I took a course in chaos theory where we discussed it.) As such, I restricted my variables to postive range
only to mimic the natural system. When r < 0, the curve goes towards the origin instead of to a different point.
For bigger R, the path is much more interesting and oscillates between points.
